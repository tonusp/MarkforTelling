# Fourteen

It was the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread in two days' time, and the chief priests and scribes were looking for a way to take him by stealth and kill him. But they said, Not during the feast, or the people will riot.

Now, when he was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, sitting at the table, a woman came in with an alabaster jar of ointment of pure nard, very costly, and she broke open the jar and poured it on his head. Some of them there were angry, Why this waste of perfume? The ointment could have been sold for more than three hundred denarii, and given to the poor; and they condemned her. But Jesus said, Leave her alone, why are you making trouble for her? She has done a good work for me. Look: you always have the poor with you, and you can do them good any time you want; but you won't always have me. She has done what she could, she has anointed my body for its burial beforehand. I'm telling you the truth: wherever the gospel is preached in all the world, what this woman has done will be told in remembrance of her.

Then Judas Iscariot, one of The Twelve, went to the chief priests to betray him. When they heard it they were glad and promised to give him a reward, and he began to look for a good opportunity to betray him.

Now, on the first day of Unleavened Bread, when they sacrificed the Passover lamb, his disciples say to him, Where do you want us to go and prepare for us to eat Passover? He sends two of his disciples and says to them, Go into the city, and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you; follow him, and wherever he goes in, say to the master of the house, The Teacher says, Where is the guestroom, where I may eat Passover with my disciples? And he will show you a large upper room, furnished and ready: make preparations for us there. And the disciples went out, and came into the city, and found it just as he had told them, and they prepared the Passover. When it was evening, Jesus arrives with The Twelve. And as they are sitting and eating, Jesus said, I'm telling you the truth: one of you will betray me, one of you eating with me. They became sad, and began to say to him one after another, Not me, surely? He said, One of The Twelve, one of you who are dipping in the dish with me. Yes, the son of man is going away, as it is written about him, but alas for that man by whom the son of man is betrayed; it would be better for that man if he had never been born.

Now while they were eating he took bread and gave thanks and broke it and gave it to them and said, Take, this is my body. Then he took a cup and gave thanks and gave it to them and they all drank from it. And he said to them, This is my blood of the covenant, poured out for all. I'm telling you the truth: I will never drink wine again, until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God. And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.

And Jesus says to them, All of you will fall away / give up, as it's written:  
I will smite the shepherd  
and the sheep will be scattered.  
But after I have been raised from death, I will go ahead of you to Galilee. Now that man Peter said to him, Even if everyone falls away, not me, I won't! Jesus says to him, I'm telling you the truth: today, this very night, before the cock crows twice, you will deny me three times. But he answered emphatically, Even if I have to die with you, I will not deny you! And all the others said exactly the same.

And they came to a place called Gethsemane and he says to the disciples, Sit here while I pray. And he takes Peter and James and John with him, and he began to be very distressed and troubled, and says to them, My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow, even to death; stay here and keep watch. He went a little further and fell on the ground and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him. He said Abba, father -- all things are possible for you. Take this cup away from me, But: not what *I* want, but what *you* want. And he comes and finds them asleep/ sleeping, and says to Peter, Simon, are you asleep? Can't you even keep watch for one hour? Keep watch and pray, that you don't come into temptation; the spirit may be willing, but the flesh is weak. He went away again and prayed, saying the same words. He came again and found them asleep, because their eyes were very heavy, and they didn't know how to answer him. A third time he comes, and says to them, Are you *still* sleeping and resting? Enough! The hour has come, look! the son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. Get up, let's go -- look, the betrayer is here.

And at once! while he was still speaking, up comes Judas, one of The Twelve, and with him a crowd with swords and spears from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders. Now his betrayer had given them a sign: The one I shall kiss, he's the man. Seize him and take him away under close guard. He came and at once went right up to him and days, Rabbi, and kissed him. And they laid hands on him and seized him. One of the bystanders drew his sword and struck the slave of the high priest and cut off his ear. And Jesus said to them, Have you come out with swords and spears to arrest me,as if I were a criminal? Every day I was with you in the temple, and you did not arrest me -- but, so that the scriptures may be fulfilled. And they all left him and fled.

Now a certain young man was following him, wearing only a linen cloth, and they seized him. But he left the linen cloth behind and ran away naked.

They led Jesus away to the high priest, and all the chief priests and elders and scribes gathered together. Now Peter followed him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest's house, and was sitting with the guards warming himself by the fire. The chief priests and all the council were looking for witnesses against Jesus, so that they could put him to death, but they could not find any. For many brought false witness against him, but their testimonies did not agree. Some stood up and testified against him, We heard him saying, I will destroy this temple made with hands, and in three days I will build another, not made with hands. But not even so did their testimonies agree. Then the high priest stood up in the midst of them and questioned Jesus, Don't you have any answer to what these testify against you? But he remained silent, and answered not a word. Again the high priest asked him, Are you the Christ / Messiah, the son of the Blessed One? Then Jesus said, I am --  
and you will see the son of man  
sitting at the right hand of Power  
and coming, with the clouds of heaven.  
Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, Why do we still need witnesses? You have heard the blasphemy; what is your verdict? They all condemned him: Guilty! Worthy of death! And some of them began to spit on him, to blindfold him and hit him and say, Prophesy, you! And the guards beat him.

Now while Peter was sitting down in the courtyard, one of the high priest's serving girls came, and saw Peter warming himself. She looked right at him and said, You were with the Nazarene too, with this Jesus. He denied it, I've no idea what you're talking about. And he went out into the gateway. [and a cock crew.] The serving girl saw him again and started saying to the bystanders, This man is one of them. He denied it again. After a little while, again the bystanders said to Peter, Truly, you *are* one of them, for you too are a Galilean. Then he began to curse and swear, I don't know this man you're talking about, so help me God. And at once! the cock crowed a second time, and Peter remembered the word that Jesus had spoken: Before the cock crows twice, you will deny me three times. And he broke down and wept.
