# MarkforTelling

This is my Mark's Gospel translation project, which aims to produce a contemporary translation for storytelling.

Most of the existing English translations are essentially literary in purpose, designed to be read off the page by solitary readers, who rarely read aloud in the way that was normal for ancient readers in the early Christian centuries. Even when used for reading in liturgical settings, as the 'lessons' in public worship, they often sound stilted or unnatural. Unlike the King James Version, which was clearly intended to be read and heard aloud, as well as being read alone, and which the translators obviously tested out in this way, many of the more recent translations don't sound easy in these contexts. In fact, some of them make me wonder why people don't laugh out loud at the infelicities in the translation.

A recent exception may be the Contemporary English Version, which claims

> The translators of the CEV followed three principles; that the CEV:  
-  must be understood by people without stumbling in speech  
-  must be understood by those with little or no comprehension of "Bible" language  
 - must be understood by all.

However, it seeks to achieve this aim by dumbing down the language. This seems highly patronising , and is definitely not the way of storytelling! The storyteller respects the audience and treats them like people who will understand what (s)he is saying, and will bring them along to make sure they *do* understand.

What you see here is a draft, or a work in progress. I hope to put up the chapters as they are completed, for comment or suggestion. Remember, if you are reading them, that they are meant to be learned, told aloud, and heard by the audience. I hope to produce audio files of each chapter and make them available here. The translation is intended to be designed for *my* voice and telling style. You may want to 'tweak' them for your own style. You're welcome to do so; but please don't use this version for commercial purposes without permission.
