Five

And they came to the other side of the sea, to the country of the Gerasenes. And when he got out of the boat, immediately a man out of the tombs with an unclean spirit met him. He actually lived in the tombs, and no one could tie him up, not even with a chain. - Because he had often been bound with shackles and with chains, but the chains he tore apart and the shackles he broke in pieces, and no one was strong enough to control him. All night and all day, among the tombs and on the mountains, he was always howling and gashing himself with stones. When he saw Jesus from a long way off, he ran and fell down at his feet and shouted in a loud voice, What do you want with me, Jesus, son of the Most High God? I beg you, in God's name, don't torture me! because he had said to him, Come out, unclean spirit, come out of the man. And he asked him, What is your name? And he said to him, My name is Legion, because we are many. And he begs him, begs him, not to send them out of that country.

Now there on the mountain, a huge herd of pigs was feeding. And he begged Jesus, Send us into the pigs; let us enter them. And Jesus gave them permission. And the unclean spirits came out and went into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea, about two thousand of them, and were drowned in the sea. And the swineherds ran for it, and told all about it, in the town and in the country. And people came to see what it was that had happened. They came to Jesus, and they see the man who had been possessed by demons sitting there, fully clothed, and in his right mind, the one who had had the legion, and they were afraid. And those who had seen what had happened to the demoniac and to the pigs, told them about it. And they began to beg Jesus to leave their district. And as he was getting into the boat, the man who had been possessed by demons begs that he might be with him. And he did not allow him, but says to him, Go home to your people and tell them what the Lord has done for you, and how he has had mercy on you. And he went away and began to tell it in the Decapolis, what Jesus had done for him, and everyone was amazed.

And when Jesus had crossed over again in the boat to the other side, a great crowd gathered around him, and he was beside the sea. Then one of the leaders of the synagogue comes to him, Jairus by name, and he sees him and falls down at his feet and begs him and begs him and begs him, My little daughter is dying, just come and lay your hands on her, so that she may be saved and live. And he went with him.

And a large crowd were following him and crowding him on every side. And a woman, who had had a flow of blood for twelve years - and she had suffered much under many doctors, and spent everything that she had, and hadn't got any better but rather grew worse - she had heard about Jesus, and she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his clothes. For she said, If I can only touch his clothes, I will be saved. And - at once! - the bleeding stopped, and she knew in her body that she was healed of her disease. And - at once! - Jesus knew in himself that power had gone out from him, he turned around in the crowd and said, Who touched my clothes? And his disciples said to him, You see the crowd pressing in on you - how can you say, Who touched me? but he went on looking around to see who had done it. But the woman knew what had happened to her, and came in fear and trembling and fell down before him and told him the whole truth. And he said to her, Daughter, your faith has saved you; go in peace, and be healed of your disease.

While he was still speaking, people came from the synagogue leader's house and said, Your daughter is dead, why trouble the teacher any more? But Jesus overheard what they said, and he said to the synagogue leader, Don't be afraid, only believe. And he didn't allow anyone to follow him except Peter and James and John, the brother of James. And they came to the synagogue leader's house, and he sees a great uproar, people weeping wailing loudly, and he went in and said to them, Why are you weeping and wailing loudly? The child isn't dead, but asleep. Well! they laughed at him - but he put them all outside, and took with him the child's father and mother, and those who were with him, and went in where the child was. And he took the child's hand and said to her, Talitha koum, which is translated, Little girl, I say to you, get up. And - at once! - the little girl stood up and began to walk around - she was about twelve years old - and everyone was amazed. And he gave them strict orders that no one was to know about this, and said, Give her something to eat.
