# Nine

And he said to them, Listen, I'm telling you the truth: some of you standing here will not taste death, until you see the kingdom of God come in power.

After six days Jesus takes along with him Peter and James and John, and leads them up a high mountain by themselves alone. And he was transformed before their eyes, like a metamorphosis, his clothes became shining dazzling white, more than any laundry on earth could make them shine. And Elijah and Moses appeared to them, and they were talking with Jesus. And Peter speaks up and says to Jesus, Rabbi, it's good for us to be here -- let us make three huts, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah -- he didn't know what he was saying, they were all scared out of their wits. And a cloud came and overshadowed them, and a voice out of the cloud: This is my son, my beloved one, listen to him. And suddenly they looked around and could no longer see anyone but Jesus alone with them.

As they were coming down from the mountain he ordered them to tell no one what they had seen, until the son of man should rise from the dead. And they kept this to themselves, as they wondered what this rising from the dead was about. And they asked him, So why do the scribes say that Elijah has to come first? And he said to them, Elijah does indeed come first to make all things ready -- and what is it that's written about the son of man? that he must suffer many things and be rejected? but I tell you that Elijah has come, and they did to him whatever they wanted, just as it's written about him.

And when they came to the disciples they saw a big crowd around them and scribes arguing with them. And at once! the whole crowd saw him and were amazed and ran up and greeted him. And he asked them, Why are you arguing together? And one man out of the crowd answered, Teacher, I brought my son to you, he has a dumb spirit, and wherever it attacks him it throws him to the ground and he foams at the mouth and grinds his teeth and becomes rigid. And I asked your disciples to drive it out and they weren't able to. And Jesus said to them, You unbelieving generation! how long do I have to be with you? how long do I have to put up with you? Bring him to me. And they brought him to Jesus. When the spirit saw him - immediately! - it threw him into convulsions and he fell to the ground and rolled around foaming at the mouth. And Jesus asked the father, How long has this been happening to him? He said, Since childhood. And it has often thrown him into the fire, or into water, trying to kill him; but if you can, help us, have pity on us. Jesus said to him, If you can, huh? If you believe, everything is possible. At once! the boy's father cried out, I believe! but help my unbelief. Jesus could see that a crowd was gathering quickly, so he rebuked the unclean spirit, he said to it, Dumb and deaf spirit, I command you, come out of him, never enter him again. And the spirit cried out, threw him about, and came out; and he lay like a dead man, so that many of the people were saying, He's dead! But Jesus took his hand and raised him up and he stood on his feet. And when he had gone into a house his disciples asked him privately, Why couldn't we drive it out? And he told them, This kind can never come out, except by prayer.

They left there and passed through Galilee, and he didn't want anyone to know it. For he was teaching his disciples, telling them, The son of man will be handed over into the hands of men and they will kill him, and three days after he is killed, he will rise again. But they didn't understand what he was saying, and were afraid to ask him.

They came to Capernaum, and when they were in the house he asked them, What were you discussing on the road? But they said nothing. Because they had been arguing on the road, about who was the greatest. He sat down and called The Twelve and says to them, If anyone wants to be first, they must be last of all, and servant of all. Then he took a little child and stood it in their midst. He put his arms around the child and said to them, If you receive one of these little children for my sake, you are receiving me; and if you receive me, you are receiving not me, but the One who sent me.

John said to him, Teacher, we saw someone driving out demons in your name, and we told him to stop, because he was not following us. But Jesus said, Don't stop him! Because no one who performs a miracle in my name can quickly speak evil of me. For whoever is not against us, is for us. If anyone gives you a drink of water because you belong to Christ, I tell you the truth, they will not lose their reward.

If anyone makes one of these little ones who believe fall into sin, it would be better for that person to have a great millstone put around their neck, and be thrown into the sea. And if your hand makes you sin, cut it off; it's better for you to enter life maimed, than to have two hands and go to hell, to unquenchable fire. And if your foot makes you sin, cut it off; it's better for you to enter life crippled, than to have two feet and be thrown into hell. And if your eye makes you sin, tear it out; it's better for you to enter the kingdom of God one-eyed, than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell, where their worm does not die, and the fire is never put out. For everyone will be salted with fire. Salt is good; but if the salt becomes unsalty, what can restore its taste? So be salty in yourselves, and be at peace with one another.
