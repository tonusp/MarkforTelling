# Eleven

And when they drew near to Jerusalem, at Bethphage and Bethany at the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two of his disciples and says to them, Go into the village ahead of you, and as soon as you enter it you will find a young donkey tied up, on which no one has ever yet ridden. Untie it and bring it here. And if anyone asks you what you are doing, say, The Lord needs it, and will send it right back. And they went off and found a young donkey, tied up at a door outside on the street, and they untie it. Some of the people standing there said to them, What are you doing, untying the donkey? And they answered just as Jesus had told them to, and they let them take it. They bring the donkey to Jesus, and spread their coats on it, and he sat on it. And many people spread their coats on the road, others cut leafy branches from the fields. Those who went in front and behind shouted, Hosanna! Blessed is the One who comes in the name of the Lord. Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David. Hosanna in the highest.

And he entered Jerusalem, into the temple, and looked around at everything. It was already late in the evening, so he went out to Bethany with The Twelve.

The next day as they left Bethany he was hungry. And he saw from far off a fig tree with leaves, so he went to see if perhaps he might find something on it; but when he came he found nothing on it except leaves, for it was not the season for figs. And he said to the tree, May no one -- ever -- eat fruit from you again. And his disciples heard it.

So they came to Jerusalem and went into the temple and he began to drive out all those who were selling or buying in the holy place, and he overturned the tables of the money-changers, and the seats of the dove-sellers, and did not allow anyone to carry anything through the holy place. And he taught them, and said, Isn't it written,  
My house shall be called a house of prayer for all nations,  
but you have made it a robbers' hideout.  
And the chief priests and scribes heard, and tried to find a way to kill him, but they were afraid of him, because all the crowd were amazed at his teaching. And when it was evening, they went out of the city.

As they were passing by early the next morning, they saw the fig tree withered from the roots. And Peter remembered, and says to him, Look, rabbi, the fig tree that you cursed has withered. Jesus answered, Have faith in God. I'm telling you the truth: Whoever says to this mountain, be taken up and thrown into the sea, and doesn't doubt in their heart, but believes that what they say will happen, it will be done for them. Therefore I tell you, Whatever you pray and ask for, just believe that you have received it, and it will be done for you. And when you stand praying, forgive if you have anything against anyone, so that your Father in heaven may also forgive you your trespasses.

They came to Jerusalem again, and as he was walking in the temple the chief priests and scribes and elders came to him and asked him, By what authority are you doing all this? And who gave you this authority to do it? Jesus said to them, I will ask you one thing; just answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do this. The baptism of John -- was it from heaven, or from men? Answer me. They argued among themselves: If we say, From heaven, he will say, Then why didn't you believe him? but if we say, From men -- they were afraid of the crowd, because all of them believed that John really was a prophet. So they answered Jesus, We do not know. And Jesus said to them, Then neither will I tell you by what authority I'm doing all this.
