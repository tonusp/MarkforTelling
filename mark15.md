# Fifteen

As soon as it was morning the chief priests met with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and they bound Jesus and led him away by force and handed him over to Pilate. Pilate asked him, Are you the king of the Jews? He answered him, You say so. And the chief priests accused him of many things. Pilate asked him again, Aren't you going to answer a word? Look how many things they are accusing you of. But Jesus answered not one word more, so that Pilate was amazed.

Now at the festival he used to release one prisoner for them, whoever they asked for. Now there was one called Barabbas, in prison with the terrorists who had committed murder during the uprising. So the crowd came up and began to ask him to do this for them. Pilate asked them, Do you want me to release for you the king of the Jews? because he knew it was out of jealousy that the chief priests had handed him over. But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to demand that he should release Barabbas for them instead. So Pilate asked them again, Then what do you want me to do with this man you call the king of the Jews? They shouted out again, Crucify him! Pilate asked them, Why? What evil has he done? But they shouted even more, Crucify him! Pilate wanted to satisfy the crowd. He released for them Barabbas. Jesus he handed over to be flogged, and then crucified.

The soldiers, then, led him away outside the fortress, which is called the Praetorium, and called the whole company together. They dressed Jesus in a purple robe, and they twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on him. And they began to salute him, Hail, king of the Jews! And they beat him about the head with a stick, and spat on him, and knelt down in "homage". When they had finished humiliating him, they stripped him of the purple robe and put his own clothes on him and led him out to crucify him.

Now they forced a passer-by, a certain Simon of Cyrene, who was coming in from the country -- the father of Alexander and Rufus -- to carry his cross. And they brought him to the place Golgotha, which is translated Place of the Skull. They gave him wine, flavoured with the drug myrrh, but he didn't take it. And they crucified him,  
and divided his clothes,  
casting lots for them, to see what each would take.  
It was the third hour when they crucified him. And the inscription of the charge against him read, The king of the Jews. And with him they crucified two criminals, one on his right and one on his left. People passing by blasphemed him / taunted him, shaking their heads and saying, Nah nah -- you were going to destroy the temple and build it again in three days -- save yourself, come down from the cross. In the same way the chief priests made fun of him among themselves, with the scribes, they said, He saved others; look, he can't save himself. This Christ, this king of Israel -- let him come down from the cross now, so that we may see and believe! And the men who were crucified with him taunted him too.

The sixth hour came, and darkness fell over the whole earth, until the ninth hour. And at the ninth hour, Jesus shouted with a loud voice, Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani? which is translated, My God, my God, why have you abandoned me? Some of the bystanders who heard it said, Listen, he's calling on Elijah. And one of them ran and filled a sponge with sour wine and put it on a stick and gave it to him to drink. He said, Wait -- let's see if Elijah will come and take him down. Jesus, with a loud cry, died. And the Great Curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom. When the centurion who was standing there facing him saw him die like this, he said, Truly, this man was the son of God. And there were women watching from a distance, among them Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Little James and of Joses, and Salome. When he was in Galilee these all followed him and served him, and many other women who had gone up to Jerusalem with him.

Now it was already evening, and since it was the day of preparation, that is the day before the sabbath, along came Joseph of Arimathea, a respected member of the council, who was also himself waiting for the kingdom of God. He boldly went in to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Pilate was amazed that he was already dead; so he called the centurion and asked him if *was* already dead. When he had found out from the centurion, he released the dead body to Joseph. He bought a linen cloth, he took him down, he wrapped him in the linen cloth, and he laid him in a tomb which was cut out of the rock, and rolled a great stone against the mouth of the tomb. Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where they laid him.
