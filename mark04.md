# Four

And again he began to teach beside the sea, and a really large crowd gathered around him, so that he got into a boat and sat there, and the whole crowd stood beside the sea, on the land. And he taught them many things in parables, and in his teaching he said to them, Listen! A sower went out to sow. And it so happened that as he sowed some fell on the path, and the birds came, and ate it up. And others fell on rocky ground, where it didn't have much soil, and at once it shot up, because it had no depth of soil; but when the sun rose it was scorched and withered and died. And others fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked them, and they bore no fruit. But others fell n good soil, and they grew up and increased and bore fruit: one thirty, one sixty, one a hundredfold. And he said: Whoever has ears to hear - listen!

Now when they were alone, those who were with him, together with The Twelve, asked him about the parables. And he said to them: To you the mystery of the kingdom of God has been given, but to those outside, everything is in parables, so that  Though they look, they may look and not see;  though they hear, they may hear and not understand;  else they may turn to God and be forgiven.

And he says to them, Don't you know this parable? then how will you know any of the parables? The sower is sowing the Word. And these are the ones on the path: wherever the word is sown, and whenever they hear, immediately Satan comes and takes away the word that has been sown in them. And these are the ones on the rocky ground, who when they hear the word, they immediately receive it with joy; but they don't have any root in themselves, but do not last, and then when trouble or persecution comes because of the word, immediately they turn away. And others are the ones sown among thorns: these are the ones who hear the word, and the cares of the present age, and the deceit of wealth, and the desire/lust for everything else come rushing in and choke the word, and it is fruitless. And then there are the ones sown in good soil, who hear the word and receive it, and who bear fruit, thirty-, sixty- and a hundredfold.

And he said to them, No one puts a lamp under a basket, or under the bed, do they? but on the lampstand. For there's nothing secret that will not be revealed; nothing hidden, that will not come to light. If anyone has ears to hear - let them hear! And he says to them, Be careful how you hear. For the measure you use to measure out to others, will be the measure that is used to give to you. Whoever has, more will be given to them; whoever has nothing, even what they have will be taken away from them.  

And he said, The kingdom of God is like this: a man sowed seed in the ground, and slept, and got up, night and day, and the seed sprouted and grew, he knew not how. The earth brings forth fruit all by itself, first the fruit, then the stalk, then the full head of grain on the stalk. And when the fruit is ripe, at once he puts in the sickle, when harvest has come.

And he said, How shall we compare the kingdom of God? or what parable shall we use to describe it? It's like a mustard seed - when it's sown in the ground, it's the smallest of all the seeds on earth; but when it is sown it grows up and becomes the biggest of all plants, and puts out great branches, so that all the birds in the sky can nest in its shade.

And with many parables like this he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear it; and without parables he did not speak to them, but privately, to his own disciples, he explained everything.

And at evening that day he says to them, Let's cross over to the other side. And they left the crowd and took him into the boat, just as he was, and there were other boats with him. And a great storm of wind arose, and the waves beat upon the boat, so that it was getting swamped. And he was in the stern, on the pillow, sleeping. And they wake him up and say to him, Teacher, don't you care that we're all going to die? And he got up and rebuked the wind and said to the sea, Calm down! Be still! And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm. And he said to them, Why are you afraid? Do you not yet have faith? And they were afraid, very afraid, and they said to each other, Who then /is/ this, that even the wind and sea obey him?
