Now, the Pharisees gathered around him, and some of the scribes (the professional religious teachers) who had come from Jerusalem. They saw some of his disciples eating bread with unclean hands -- that is, without having washed --

Now, the Pharisees and all the Jews keep the tradition of the elders: they don't eat, unless they wash their hands in the ritual way. And there are many other traditions which they keep: ritual washing of cups and jugs and bowls (and beds!) ...

So the Pharisees and the scribes asked him, Why do your disciples not walk according to the traditions of the elders, but eat their bread with ritually unclean hands? He said to them, Isaiah prophesied well against you -- hypocrites! Like this:  
This people honours me with their lips  
but their hearts couldn't be any further away from me.  
In vain do they worship me,  
teaching human teachings and rules.

When you keep your human teachings, you abandon God's commandment. And he said to them, You so reject reject the commandment of God, so that you can follow your precious tradition. Look, Moses said  
Honour your father and your mother,  
and, Whoever bad-mouths father or mother must die the death.  
But you say, If a man says to his father or mother Korban -- that is, It's a gift promised to God, the assistance you need from me -- you no longer allow him to do anything for his father or mother! You nullify the word of God, by this tradition you pass on! And you do so many other things like that.

And he called the crowd to him again and said to them, Listen to me, all of you, and understand this. There is nothing outside a person that can go into them and make them defiled or unclean. But it's the things that come out of a person that defile them. And when he had gone inside the house, away from the crowd, his disciples asked him about the parable. He said to them, Don't you get it either, then? Don't you understand that anything from outside that goes into a person cannot defile them, because it doesn't go into their heart but into their stomach, and then goes out into the sewer. (By saying this, he declared that all foods were 'clean', acceptable to eat.)

And he said, What comes out of a person, that's what defiles them. For from within, out of a person's heart, come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery, greed, wickedness, deceit, indecency, envy, blasphemy, pride, every kind of folly. All these things come out from inside, and they are what defile a person.

From there Jesus got up and went away to the region of Tyre. He went into a house and didn't want anyone to know that he was there, but he couldn't remain hidden. But -- immediately! -- a woman heard about him, whose daughter had an unclean spirit. She came and fell down at his feet. Now this woman was a Greek, a Syro-Phoenician by birth, and she asked him to cast the demon out of her daughter. And he said to her, Let's feed the children first. It's not right or good to take the children's bread away from them, and throw it to the dogs. But she answered, Lord, even the dogs under the table eat the little children's crumbs. And he said to her, For saying that you can go: the demon has gone out of your daughter. And she went away to her home, and found the little child lying on her bed, and the demon -- gone.

And again he left the regions of Tyre and came through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee, through the region of Decapolis. And people brought to him a deaf mute, and ask him to place his hand on him. Jesus took him away from the crowd by themselves, put his fingers into his ears, spat, and touched his tongue; then he looked up to heaven, groaned, and says to him Ephphatha, which means, Be opened! And -- immediately! -- his ears were opened, and whatever had tied his tongue was loosed, and he spoke plainly. And Jesus ordered them to tell no one. But the more he ordered them, the more they spread the word to everyone, everywhere. And they were completely amazed; they said, He has done everything well; he even makes the deaf hear and the dumb speak.
