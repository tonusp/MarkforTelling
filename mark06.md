# Six

And he left that place and went to his home town, and his disciples followed him. And when the sabbath came, he began to teach in the synagogue, and many of those who heard him were amazed and said, Where does he get all this? And what is this wisdom that he has been given? and these works of power done by his hands? Isn't this the carpenter, Mary's son, and the brother of James and Joses and Jude and Simon, and aren't his sisters all here with us? And they took offence at him. And Jesus said to them, No prophet is without honour, except in his home town and among his own kinfolk and in his home. And he couldn't do any work of power there, except to heal a few sick people by placing his hands on them; and he was amazed at their unbelief.

And he went about the neighbouring villages teaching. And he called The Twelve to him and began to send them out two by two, and gave them power-and-authority over the unclean spirits. And he ordered them to take nothing with them in the way except a staff: no bread, no bag, no money in their belts, but sandals on their feet, and not to wear two shirts. And he said to them, Wherever you enter a house, stay there until you leave that place. And anywhere they won't receive you or listen to you, just leave that place and shake off the dust from under your feet, as a witness against them. And they went out and preached that people should turn their lives around, and they cast out many demons, and anointed many sick people with olive oil and healed them.

Now the king Herod heard, for Jesus' name had become known, and some were saying John the baptizer had been raised from the dead, and for this reason powers were at work in him. Others were saying, He is Elijah, and others, He is a prophet, like one of the prophets. When Herod heard about it, he said, John, whom I beheaded, has been raised. Now Herod himself had sent and arrested John, and bound him in prison because of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip, because he has married her. And John had said to Herod, It's not lawful for you to have your brother's wife. So Herodias held a grudge against him and wanted to kill him, but she could not. Because Herod was afraid of John. He knew that he was a righteous and holy man, and protected him, and when he listened to John he was greatly perplexed, but he listened to him gladly. But a suitable occasion arose when it was Herod's birthday, and he gave a great feast for all the great and the good, his magnates, his generals, and all the leading men of Galilee. And the daughter of Herodias came in and danced -- and pleased Herod -- and those at table with him.

The king said to the girl, Ask me anything you like, and I will give it to you. And he promised her anything: Whatever you ask me, I will give you -- even as much as half my kingdom. And she went out and said to her mother, What shall I ask for? She said, The head of John the baptizer. At once! -- she went in quickly to the king and said, I want you, right now, to give me on a platter the head of John the Baptist. And the king was very sorry because of his oaths, and his guests, and he didn't want to break his word... So -- at once! -- the king sent an executioner with orders to bring his head, and he went and took off his head in the prison, and brought the head on a platter and gave it to the girl, and the girl gave it to her mother. And when John's disciples heard about it they came and took his body and laid it in a tomb.

Now the apostles came to Jesus and told him about what they had done and taught. And he said to them, Come away by yourselves to a secluded place and rest a little. For many people were coming and going, and they didn't even have time to eat. And they went away in the boat to a deserted place by themselves. Now, many people saw them going away, and recognized them, and they ran on foot from all the villages and arrived there ahead of them. So when Jesus got out of the boat he saw a huge crowd, and he had pity on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd, and he began to teach them many things.

Now when it was already getting late, his disciples came to him and said, Look, this is a remote place and it's already late; send these people away, so they can go to the farms and villages round about and buy themselves something to eat. But he answered them, You give them something to eat. They said, Are we supposed to buy six months' wages' worth of food and give it to them!? He said to them, How many loaves do you have? Go and see. And when they'd found out they said, Five, and two fishes. And he ordered them to make everyone sit down on the green green grass. And they sat down in groups of about a hundred or about fifty. Jesus took the five loaves and the two fishes; he looked up to heaven, blessed and broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples to share out, and he divided the fishes among them all. And all the people ate and were filled; and they picked up twelve baskets full of broken pieces of the bread and the fishes. And the number who had eaten was five thousand people.

And -- at once! -- he made his disciples get into the boat and go on ahead to the other side, to Bethsaida, while he sent the crowd away. And when he had said goodbye to the crowd, he went up the mountain to pray. And late in the evening, the boat was in the middle of the sea, and he was alone on the land. And he saw them struggling hard as they rowed, because the wind was against them, and about the fourth watch of the night he comes to them, walking on the sea, and he wanted to pass them by. When they saw him on the sea, walking, they thought it was a ghost and cried out, because they all saw him and were terrified. But -- at once! -- he spoke to them and said, Pull yourselves together, it's me -- don't be afraid. And he climbed into the boat with them and made the wind stop. And they were utterly amazed, because they didn't understand about the loaves; instead, their hearts were hardened.

When they had crossed over they came to land at Gennesareth and went ashore. And when they had got out of the boat -- at once! -- people recognised him and ran about that whole region and began to bring the sick on stretchers wherever they heard that he was. And wherever he went, to villages or towns or farms, they laid the sick in the market places and begged him to let them touch even the hem of his clothes, and everyone who touched him was healed.
