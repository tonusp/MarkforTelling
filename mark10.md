# Ten

He left there and came to the regions of Judaea and Beyond Jordan, and again crowds gathered around him, and again he taught them, as he was accustomed to do. Now Pharisees came and asked him, Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife? - It was to test him. He answered, What did Moses command you? They said, Moses allowed a man to write a written notice of divorce, and put her away. Jesus said to them, It was because of your hard hearts that he wrote this commandment; but from the beginning of creation, God created them male and female, and, because of this a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two of them will become one flesh. So, they are no longer two, but one flesh. So, what God has joined together, let no man put asunder. And when they were in the house again, the discipled asked him about this. And he says to them, Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her, and if a woman divorces her husband and marries another, she commits adultery.

And people were bringing their little children to Jesus, for him to touch them; and the disciples rebuked them. But when Jesus saw it he was angry and said to them, Let the little children come to me, don't try to stop them! The kingdom of God belongs to ones like them. I'm telling you the truth, anyone who does not receive the kingdom of God as a little child does, will never enter it. And he put his arms around them, placed his hands on them, and blessed them.

And when he set out on the way, a man ran up to him and knelt down in front of him and asked him, Good teacher, what must I do to gain eternal life? Jesus said to him, Why do you call me 'good'? No one is good, except for God alone. Look, you know the commandments: Thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not commit adultery, thou shalt not steal, thou shalt not bear false witness, thou shalt not cheat, honour thy father and thy mother. He said to him, Teacher, all these I have kept, ever since my youth. Jesus looked right at him and loved him, and said to him, Just one thing you lack: go and sell whatever you have, and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come! follow me. When he heard these words, his face fell, and he went away miserable -- because he had many possessions

And Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, How hard it is, for people with possessions to get into the kingdom of God! And the disciples were shocked when they heard this. So Jesus said to them again, Children, how hard it is to get into the kingdom of God! It is easier for a camel to get through the eye of a needle, than for a rich person to get into the kingdom of God. They were even more amazed and said to each other, Then -- who *can* be saved? Jesus looked straight at them, and says, For men and women, it's impossible; but not for God. For anything and everything is possible for God. Peter began to say to him, Look -- we have left everything and followed you. Jesus said, I'm telling you the truth: no one who has left home or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or lands for my sake and for the sake of the gospel, but they will receive a hundred times as much now in this age: houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and lands with persecutions -- and in the age to come life, eternal life. And many of the first will be last, and the last will be first.

Now they were on the way going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was walking on ahead of them, and they were amazed, and those who were following were afraid. Jesus took The Twelve aside again and began to tell them the things that were going to happen to him: Look, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the son of man will be handed over to the chief priests and the scribes, and they will condemn him to death and hand him over to the Gentiles, and they will mock him and spit on him and flog him and kill him. And after three days, he will rise again.

Then James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came to him and said, Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask of you. He said, What do you want me to do for you? They said, Let one of us sit at your right hand in your glory, and one at your left. Jesus said to them, You don't know what you are asking. Can you drink the cup that I drink, or be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with? They said to him, We can. And Jesus said to them, The cup that I drink, you shall drink; and the baptism that I am baptized with, you shall be baptized with too. But to sit at my right hand or my left is not mine to give, but it is for those it has been prepared for. When the other ten heard about it, they began to be angry with James and John. But Jesus called them to him and said to them, You know that those who seem to be the rulers of the nations lord it over them, and their great men wield power over them. But it's not like that with you, but whoever wants to be great among you must be your servant, and whoever wants to be first among you must be a slave of all. For even the son of man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.

And they came to Jericho, and as he was leaving Jericho with his disciples and quite a crowd, the son of Timaeus, Bartimaeus, a blind beggar, was sitting by the roadside. When he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth he began to shout out Son of David! Jesus! Have mercy on me! Many of them told him off: Shut up! But he only shouted all the more, Son of David, have mercy on me! Jesus stood still and said, Call him. And they called the blind man, Hey, cheer up! He's calling you. He threw off his coat, jumped up and came to Jesus. Jesus asked him, What do you want me to do for you? And the blind man said, Rabbouni (Teacher), that I may be able to see. And Jesus said to him, Go, your faith has saved you. And -- at once! -- he was able to see; and he followed Jesus on the way.
