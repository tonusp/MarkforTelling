# Eight

In those days, when again there was a great crowd and they had nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples to him and said to them, I have pity on this crowd, because they have already been with me for three days, and they have nothing to eat. And if I send them away to their homes hungry, they will faint on the way -- and some of them have come a long way. His disciples answered him, Where can we get bread to feed all these, here in the desert? And he asked them, How many loaves do you have? They said, Seven. And he told the crowd to sit down on the ground, then he took the seven loaves, blessed, and broke, and gave them to his disciples to distribute and they distributed them to the crowd. And they had a few small fishes, and he blessed and gave thanks for them, and told the disciples to distribute these too. And they all ate and were filled. And they picked up seven even bigger baskets of leftover pieces. And there were about four thousand people. And he sent them away. And at once he got into the boat with his disciples and came to the district of Dalmanutha.

Now the Pharisees came out and began to argue with him, asking him for a sign from heaven, testing him. And Jesus sighed deeply in his spirit and said, Why is this generation always looking for a sign? I'm telling you the truth: no sign -- no sign! -- will be given to this generation. He left them, got into the boat again, and went away to the other side.

Now they had forgotten to take any bread, and they had nothing with them in the boat, except one loaf.  And Jesus warned them: Look out! Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees, and the yeast of Herod. And they discussed among themselves, Is it because we have no bread? Jesus knew what they were thinking and said to them, Why are you talking about not having bread? Don't you know or understand yet? Are your hearts so senseless? (Are you all so thick?) You've got eyes -- why don't you see? You've got ears -- can't you hear? Don't you remember -- when I broke the five loaves for the five thousand -- how many baskets full of broken pieces did you pick up? They said, Twelve. And the seven loaves for the four thousand -- how many even bigger baskets full of broken pieces did you pick up? Seven, they said. And he said to them, Do you still not understand?

They came to Bethsaida. And people brought to him a blind man and asked him to touch him. Jesus took the blind man by the hand and led him outside the village. Then he spat in his eyes, placed his hands on him and asked, Can you see anything? He looked up and said, I can see men, like trees I can see them, walking. Then again Jesus placed his hands on his eyes, and he looked intently and was healed and saw everything clearly. And Jesus sent him to his home, and said, Don't even go into the village.

Now Jesus and his disciples went off to the villages of Caesarea Philippi. And on the way he asked his disciples, Who are people saying that I am? They said to him, John the Baptist, and others say, Elijah, and others, One of the prophets. He asked them, And what about you? Who do you say that I am? It was Peter who answered, and said to him, You are the Messiah, the Christ! And he ordered them to tell no one about him.

At this time he began to teach them that the son of man would have to suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders and the high priests and the scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise from the dead. He told them this quite plainly. Then Peter came to him and rebuked him. But Jesus turned and saw his disciples there and he rebuked Peter. He said, Get behind me, you Satan! Because you are thinking not God's thoughts, but the thoughts of men. And he called the crowd to him with his disciples and said to them, If anyone wants to come after me, they must deny themselves, and take up their cross and follow me. For anyone who wants to save their life will lose it, and anyone who loses their life for my sake and for the gospel will save it. For what profit is it for a person to gain the whole world, and forfeit their life? What can a person give in exchange for their life? For whoever is ashamed of me and of my words, in this adulterous and sinful generation, the son of man will be ashamed of them, when he comes in his Father's glory, with the holy angels.
