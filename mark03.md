# Three

Again he went into the synagogue, and there was a man with a withered hand. And they were watching him closely, to see if he would heal him on the sabbath, so that they might bring an accusation against him. And he says to the man with the withered hand, “Come out into the middle.” And he says to them, “Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath?  or to do evil? To save a life, or to kill?” But they said never a word. And Jesus looked around at them with anger, feeling sorry for their hard-heartedness, and he says to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” And he stretched it out, and his hand was restored. And the Pharisees went out at once with the Herodians and plotted against him, how they could kill him.

And Jesus with his disciples withdrew to the sea, and a huge number of people from Galilee and from Judaea and from Jerusalem and from Idumea and beyond the Jordan and around Tyre and Sidon, this huge number had heard what he did and came to him. And he told his disciples to get a boat ready for him because of the crowd, so that they might not crush him; because he had healed many people, and they were crowding around him so that any who were ill might touch him; and the unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him and shouted You are the son of God! And he ordered them sternly not to reveal his identity.  

And Jesus goes up the mountain, and calls to him the ones he wanted, and they come to him. And he made The Twelve, whom he also called apostles, so that they might be-with him, and so that he might send them out to preach, and to have authority-and-power to cast out the demons. So the Twelve were Simon (Jesus gave him the nickname Peter) and James son of Zebedee and John the brother of James, and he gave them the nickname Boanerges, which means The Thunder Boys, and Andrew and Philip and Bartholomew and Matthew and Thomas and James the son of Alphaeus and Thaddaeus and Simon the Cananaean and Judas Iscariot, who was the one who betrayed him.

And he goes into a house, and again a crowd gathers, so that they couldn’t even eat. And when they heard about, his family came out to get him, because people were saying he’d gone crazy. Now the scribes who had come down from Jerusalem were saying: He has Beelzebul! and, It’s by the Prince of Demons that he is casting out the demons. And he called them to him and said to them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan? Because if a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom won’t be able to stand; and if a household is divided against itself, that household won’t be able to stand. And if Satan rebels against himself and is divided, he won’t be able to stand but will meet his end. But no one can break into a strong man’s house and plunder his stuff, unless he first ties up the strong man, and then they will plunder the house. I’m telling you the truth: everything will be forgiven you people - every sin, every blasphemy you have uttered. But anyone who sins against the Holy Spirit, will not be forgiven - ever! - but is guilty of an eternal sin. Because they were saying, He has an unclean spirit.

Now his mother and his brothers arrive, and standing outside they send a message to call him. And a crowd was sitting around him, and they say to him, Look, your mother and your brothers and your sisters are outside, looking for you. And Jesus answers, Who is my mother? and my brothers? And he looked around at those sitting all around him and says, Look! here are my mother and my brothers. For anyone who does the will of God, they are my brother and sister - and mother.
