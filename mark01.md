The Good news of Jesus Christ, the son of God. It begins like this:

As it is written in Isaiah the prophet,  
Behold! I send my messenger before your face, 
to prepare your way: 
The voice of one crying in the wilderness:  
Prepare the way of the Lord; Make his paths straight!

John the baptizer appeared in the wilderness, announcing a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.  [Turn around! Change your minds, change your hearts, change your lives, and be baptized.]  And the whole region of Judaea went out to him, and all the people of Jerusalem, and were baptized by him in the River Jordan, confessing their sins.

Now John was dressed in camel's hair, and a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey.

And he preached, Someone mightier is coming after me; I am not worthy to stoop down and untie the strap of his sandals. I'm baptizing you with water, but he will baptize you in the Holy Spirit.

And it happened in those days that Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized, into the Jordan, by John. And at once! As he came up out of the water he saw the heavens torn apart, and the Spirit like a dove coming down on him. And a voice came out of heaven: You are my Son, my beloved Son: with you I am well pleased.

And - at once! - the Spirit drove him out into the wilderness. And he was in the wilderness for forty days, tempted by Satan; and he was with the wild animals; and the angels served him.

Now, after John was arrested, Jesus came into Galilee, announcing the good news of God, and saying The time is fully ripe, and the kingdom of God has come near. Repent [change your minds] and believe in the good news.

And as he was passing by the sea of Galilee he saw Simon and Andrew, Simon's brother, casting their nets into the sea; because they were fishermen. And Jesus said to them, Come, follow me, and I will make you fishers of men [and women, and children - of all people.] And - at once! - they left their nets and followed him. He went on a little further and saw James the son of Zebedee, and John, his brother, and they were in the boat cleaning their nets, and at once! he called them. And they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and went with him.

And they went into Capernaum and at once on the sabbath day he went into the synagogue and began to teach. And they were amazed at his teaching, for he was teaching them like someone who has authority, not like the scribes, [the professional religious teachers]. And at once, there in their synagogue, there was a man with an unclean spirit, and he shouted out, What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are: the holy one of God! And Jesus stood up to him, he said Shut up! and come out of him. And the unclean spirit shook him about, cried out with a loud voice, and came out of him. And everyone was amazed and began to discuss it among themselves: What is this? A new teaching - with authority - he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him. And - at once! - the news about him began to spread out everywhere, into the whole surrounding region of Galilee.

And at once he left the synagogue and went to Simon and Andrew's house, with James and John. Now, Simon's mother-in-law was lying in bed with a fever, and at once they told him about her. He went to her, took her by the hand, and raised her up, and the fever left her, and she began to wait on them.

That evening at sunset they brought to him all the sick and the demon-possessed, and the whole city was gathered in front of the door; and he healed many who were sick with all kinds of diseases, and cast out many demons, and he did not allow the demons to speak, because they knew him.

And early in the morning, long before break of day, he got up and went out and went away to a deserted place and there he prayed. And Simon and the others with him came in search of him and said, Everyone is looking for you, and he says to them: Let's go elsewhere to the neighbouring towns, so that I may preach there also - for that's why I came out. And he went all through Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons.

And a leper comes up to him, falls on his knees and begs him, If you want to, you can make me clean. And Jesus had pity on him, stretched out his hand and touched him, and said I do want to. Be clean! And - at once! - the leprosy left him, and he was made clean. And Jesus strictly warned him and sent him away at once - he said to him, See that you say nothing to anybody, but go and show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded, as a witness to them. But he went out and began to spread the word and tell all about it, so that Jesus could no longer go into town openly, but he stayed outside in deserted places, and the people came out to him from everywhere.
