# Sixteen

And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and Salome bought spices to go and anoint him. And very early on the first day of the week they come to the tomb, at sunrise. They were saying to one another, Who will roll away the stone for us, from the mouth of the tomb? And they looked up, and saw that the stone was rolled away; and it was big, very. And they went into the tomb and saw a young man sitting on the right hand side dressed in a white robe, and they were terrified. But he said to them, Don't be afraid -- you're looking for Jesus of Nazareth, the crucified one. He has been raised, he's not here. Look, there is the place where they laid him. But go, say to his disciples and Peter, he is going on ahead of you to Galilee, there you will see him, just as he told you. And they went out and fled from the tomb, for trembling had seized them, and they were beside themselves with astonishment, and they said nothing to anyone. For they were afraid.
