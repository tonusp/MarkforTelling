And when Jesus came into Capernaum again after a few days, it was reported that he was in the house. And many people gathered, so that there was no longer room for them, not even in front of the door, and he was speaking the word to them. And they came to him, bringing to him a paralyzed man, carried by four of them. And when they couldn’t bring him to Jesus, because of the crowd, they just dug through the roof where he was, and when they had dug through it, they lowered the mat on which the paralytic lay.

Jesus saw their faith, and he says to the paralytic: “Child, your sins are forgiven.”

Now, some of the scribes were sitting there, questioning in their hearts: Why is this fellow talking like this? it’s blasphemy. Who can forgive sins, except God alone?

And at once Jesus knew in his spirit that they were questioning like this among themselves, and he says to them, “Why are you questioning these things in your hearts? Which is easier: to say to the paralytic, Your sins are forgiven, or to say, Get up, pick up your mat, and walk?  But so that you may know that the son of man has power-and-authority to forgive sins on earth” - he says to the paralytic - “I say to you: get up, pick up your mat, and go home.” And he got up and - at once! - picked up his mat and went out in front of them all, so that they were all astounded and gave glory to God, saying “We’ve never seen anything like this.”

And Jesus went out again beside the sea, and the whole crowd came to him, and he taught them. And as he passed by he saw Levi, the son of Alphaeus, sitting at the tax booth; and he says to him “Follow me.” And he stood up and followed him. And what happened was, he was sitting in Levi’s house, and a lot of tax collectors and sinners were sitting with Jesus and his disciples; for there were a lot of them following him. And the scribes of the Pharisees saw that he’s eating with the sinners and tax collectors, and they said to his disciples, “Why is he eating with the tax collectors and sinners?” and Jesus hear and says to them, “The people who need a doctor are not the ones who are well, but the ones who are sick! I didn’t come to call good people, but sinners.”

Now the disciples of John, and of the Pharisees, were fasting. And they come and say to him, “Why are the disciples of John, and the disciples of the Pharisees, fasting, but your disciples are not fasting?” And Jesus said to them “Can wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them? Of course not! For as long as the bridegroom is with them, they cannot fast. But days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast, on that day. No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth onto an old coat - if they do, the patch tears away, the new from the old, and you’ve got a worse tear. And no one pours new wine into old wineskins; if they do, the wine bursts the wineskins and the wine is lost and the wineskins. But new wine, new wineskins.”

Now as it happened he was going through the grainfields on the sabbath day, and his disciples began picking the heads of grain. And the Pharisees said to him, “Look, why are they doing what’s not allowed on the sabbath?” And he says to them, “Have you never read what David did when he had need and was hungry, he and those who were with him, how they went into the house of God when Abiathar was the high priest, and ate the loaves that had been offered to God, which no one is allowed to eat except the priests, and also gave them to those who were with him?”  And he said to them: “The sabbath was made for Man, not Man for the sabbath. So the son of man is lord even of the sabbath.”
