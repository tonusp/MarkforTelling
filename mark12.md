And he began to speak to them in parables.

A vineyard. A man planted a vineyard, and built a wall around it and dug a winepress and built a watchtower and rented it out to tenants and left the country. And when the time came, he sent a slave to the tenants, to collect his share of the fruit of the vineyard. But they seized him, beat him up, and sent him away empty-handed. And again he sent another slave to them, and this one they beat about the head and treated shamefully, humiliated him. And he sent another, and this one they killed, and many others, some they beat, some they killed. He still had one, a beloved son; he sent him to them last of all, saying, They will respect my son. But those tenants said to one another, This is the son and heir; come on, let's kill him, and we'll get his inheritance. So they seized him and killed him and threw him out, out of the vineyard. Now, what will the lord, the owner of the vineyard, do? He will come and kill those tenants, and give the vineyard to others. Haven't you read this scripture?  
The stone which the builders rejected,  
this has become the chief cornerstone;  
the Lord has done this,  
and it is marvellous in our eyes.

And they tried to arrest him, but were afraid of the crowd, because they knew that it was about them, this parable that he had told. And they left him and went away.

Now they sent some of the Pharisees and Herodians, to try and trap him in what he said. They came up and say to him, Teacher, we know that you are true, and you don't care what anyone thinks, for you don't care about appearances, but teach the way of God in truth. Is it lawful to give taxes to Caesar, or not? To pay them, or not to pay them? He knew their hypocrisy, and said to them, Why are you testing me? Bring me a denarius, let me see it. They brought one, and he says to them, Whose image is this? and whose inscription? They said, Caesar's. Jesus said to them, Then give back to Caesar what belongs to Caesar. And give to God, what belongs to God.And they were completely amazed at him.

The Sadducees came up to him -- these are the ones who say there is no resurrection -- and asked him, Teacher, Moses wrote for us that  
if a man's brother dies, leaving a wife but no children, he should take his brother's wife and raise up children for his brother.  
Now, there were seven brothers; and the first took a wife and died without leaving any children, so the second married her, and he also died without leaving any children, and the third too -- and all seven left no children by her. Last of all, the woman died too. Now, in this "resurrection" -- whose wife will she be? because all seven of them had her as wife? Jesus answered them, Isn't this why you are wrong? because you know neither the scriptures, nor the power of God. For when they rise from the dead they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but they are like angels in the heavens. But about the dead, that they really do rise, haven't you read in the book of Moses, at the burning bush, how God says to him, I AM the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. He is not God of the dead, but of the living! You are so wrong.

Now one of the scribes came up and heard them arguing, and saw that Jesus answered well, and so he asked him, Which is the first commandment of all? Jesus answered, The first is, Hear O Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord, and you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength. And the second is this, You shall love your neighbour as yourself. There is no other commandment greater than these. And the scribe said to him, Well said, Teacher; you've spoken truly that God is one, and there is no other besides him, and to love him with all your heart and with all your understanding and with all your strength, and to love your neighbour as yourself, is more important than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices. And Jesus saw that he had answered wisely, and said to him, You are not far from the kingdom of God. After that, no one dared to question him any further.

Jesus himself put this question to them, when he was teaching in the temple: How is it that the scribes say the Christ is the son of David? David himself said, in the Holy Spirit,  
The Lord said to my lord,  
Sit at my right hand,  
until I put your enemies under your feet.  
David himself calls him Lord -- so how can he be his son?  
And the whole crowd heard him gladly.

And in his teaching he said, Watch out for the scribes, who want to walk around in long robes, and be greeted in the market places, and get the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honour at banquets. Who cheat widows out of their houses, and say great long fake prayers -- all of these will receive even worse condemnation.

Now, when he was sitting opposite the treasury, he saw how the crowd were throwing money into the offering box, and many rich people were putting in large amounts; and one poor widow came by and put in two tiny copper coins, that is a quadrans (one brass farthing). Jesus called his disciples to him and said, I'm telling you the truth: this poor widow put in more than all those tossing money into the offering box. Because all of them gave out of their abundance, what they could easily spare; but she, out of her poverty, gave all that she had, her whole life.

And as he was leaving the temple one of his disciples said to him, Teacher, look at all these wonderful stones! what wonderful buildings! And Jesus said to them, You see these great buildings? Not one stone will be left upon another; all of them will be torn down.

As he was sitting on the Mount of Olives opposite the Temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately, Tell us, when will these things be? and what will be the sign that all these things are about to happen? Jesus began to say to them, Watch out that no one deceives you. Many will come in my name and say, I am he, and they will deceive many. But when you hear of wars and rumours of wars, don't be alarmed. All this must happen, but the end is not yet. Nation will rise up against nation, kingdom against kingdom, there will be earthquakes here and there, there will be famines -- these are just the start of the troubles. Watch out for yourselves: they will hand you over to councils, you will be beaten in synagogues, you will stand before rulers and kings because of me, to be a witness to them. And the gospel must first be preached to all the nations. And when they take you and hand you over, don't worry beforehand about what to say, but whatever is given to you at that hour, say that, because it's not you speaking but the Holy Spirit. Brother will betray his brother to death, and a father his child, and children will turn against their parents and kill them, and you will be hated by all for my name's sake. But if you remain faithful to the end, you will be saved.

When you see the abomination of desolation standing where it ought not to be (get it?) then let those in Judaea flee to the mountains, those on the housetops not go down to into their homes to take anything out, those in the field not turn back even to pick up a coat. Alas for those who are pregnant in those days, or breast-feeding. Pray that it won't be in winter. For in those days there will be suffering such as as there has never been from the beginning of the creation that God created until now, and never will be again. And if the Lord had not shortened those days, no living thing would be saved; but for the sake of the elect, his chosen ones, he has shortened the days. And if anyone says to you, Look, here is the messiah! or Look, there! -- do not believe them. False messiahs will arise, and false prophets, and they will perform signs and wonders to deceive even the chosen ones, if possible. But you, watch out; I have told you all this beforehand.
